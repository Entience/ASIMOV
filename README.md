# ASIMOV

ASIMOV (Algorithm of Selectivity by Incentive and Motivation for Optimized Valuation) models foraging decision, based on an earlier simulation (Cyberslug) with the explicit implementation of reward experience, pain, and homeostatic plasticity. The model provides insights on the nature and course of the addiction process. 

To run ASIMOV and inspect the code, the multi-agent modeling program NetLogo must be acquired from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.
