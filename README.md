# ASIMOV

**ASIMOV** (short for “Algorithm of Selectivity by Incentive and Motivation for Optimized Valuation”) is an agent-based simulation of decision-making processes. It provides a fundamental framework for developing artificial animal behavior and cognition through step-wise modifications, where pre-existing circuitry is plausibly modified for changing function and tested, as in natural evolutionary exaptation. ASIMOV was built on an earlier simulation, [**Cyberslug**](https://github.com/Entience/Cyberslug), which is based on the behaviors and neuronal circuitry of the simple predatory sea slug _Pleurobranchaea californica_. In Cyberslug, a forager affectively integrates sensation, motivation (hunger), and learning to make cost-benefit decisions for approach or avoidance of prey. ASIMOV builds upon this with the explicit implementation of reward experience, pain, and homeostatic plasticity, providing insights on the nature and course of the addiction process, as an extreme expression of aesthetic preference.

To run ASIMOV and inspect the code, the multi-agent modeling program NetLogo must be acquired from https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/.
